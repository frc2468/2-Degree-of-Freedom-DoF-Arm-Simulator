# 2-Degree-of-Freedom-DoF-Arm-Simulator
A 2DOF has two degrees of freedom (ex: think about your arm as a subsystemâ€“your elbow and shoulder joint act as a 2DOF!). Our code simulates the movement of a 2DOF arm using inverse kinematics, calculating the angles and setpoints of the two arms needed to reach a given point.
